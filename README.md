# XP Project

This project was created for educational purposes, with the aim of learning the XP (Extreme Programming) methodology and developing C# programming skills.

## Description of the project

The XP Project is a set of classes and unit tests designed to demonstrate XP principles in software development. The project covers various aspects, such as creating classes, writing tests, and using the XP methodology in the development process.

## Classes

1. **RomanNumber** - Class for working with Roman numerals. Contains the `Parse` method, which parses the Roman notation of a number and returns its numeric value.

The project also includes a set of unit tests developed using a unit testing framework to test the functionality of the classes. Some of the tests are listed below:

1. **TestRomanNumberParseValid** - Unit tests to check the correct operation of the `Parse` method of the `RomanNumber` class for valid Roman numerals.

2. **TestRomanNumberParseInvalid** - Unit tests to test exception handling when trying to parse invalid Roman numerals.
